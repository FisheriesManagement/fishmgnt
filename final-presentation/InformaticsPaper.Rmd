## Introduction


### Fisheries in Costa Rica


### Objectives


### Data

We used a time series data of landings in Costa Rica from 1990 until 2013 collected by INCOPESCA, the governmental institution in charge of fisheries management in the country. The data set contains different species and groups of species caught in the country, and it's divided into regions. For the purpose of our project, we focused in Guanacaste region, specifically with pargo seda and pargo.  The data is in an excel file, separated by year. 

## Methods

Data reading, wrangling, visualization and management were developed with packages, functions and tools covered in the Environmental Informatics course from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.

Topics on this course included  basic computing environment (hardware and operating systems); programming language concepts; program design; data organization; software tools; generic analytical techniques (relational algebra, graphics & visualization, etc.); and specific characteristics of environmental information.

## Results
