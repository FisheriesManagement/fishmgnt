# Types of data

We will use a time series data of landings in Costa Rica from 1990 until 2013 collected by INCOPESCA, the governmental institution in charge of fisheries management in the country. The data set contains different species and groups of species caught in the country, and it's divided into regions. For the purpose of our project, we will focus only in the Guanacaste region, specifically with pargo seda and pargo.  

The data is in an excel file, separated by year. 


# Data and metadata standards




# Policies for access and sharing




# Policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution

Describe policies surrounding the re-use of your data – the EAR division is specifically interested in how soon you will make your data available. If you will not be making the data available for re-use immediately, explain why. Remember that EAR specifies that you must make your data available no later than two years after your research is complete. If there are other policy issues regarding data access and re-use (ethical or privacy issues, for instance) elaborate on them here. Consider these questions:

When will you make the data available?
Does the original data collector/creator/principal investigator retain the right to use the data before opening it up to wider use?
Will any permission restrictions need to be placed on the data?
How long will the original data collector/creator/principal investigator retain the right to use the data before making them available for wider distribution?
Are there any embargo periods for political/commercial/patent reasons? If so, give details.
Are there ethical and privacy issues? If so, how will these be resolved?
What have you done to comply with your obligations in your IRB Protocol?
Who will hold the intellectual property rights to the data and how might this affect data access?
What and who are the intended or foreseeable uses / users of the data?

EZID, a service from the University of California Curation Center, facilitates data sharing, data reuse, data citation, and data attribution, and creates Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for research data.
The Merritt Repository can restrict access to data to just the depositor or to a research group, or make data publicly available. Research data and records will be maintained for as long as they are of continuing value to the researchers and project collaborators. Data will be retained subject to the University of California retention policy.

# Plans for archiving and preservation of access

Describe your long-term strategy for archiving and preserving your data. EAR encourages PIs to submit data to an “EAR-specified” repository. Consider the following:

What is the long-term strategy for maintaining, curating and archiving the data?
Which archive/repository/database have you identified as a place to deposit data?
What procedures does your intended long-term data storage facility have in place for preservation and backup?
How long will/should data be kept beyond the life of the project?
What data will be preserved for the long-term?
What transformations will be necessary to prepare data for preservation / data sharing?
What metadata/ documentation will be submitted alongside the data or created on deposit/ transformation in order to make the data reusable?
What related information will be deposited?
